            <p className="home-text">
                Route Ticket was developed to connect infrustructure planners with their citizens to 
                provide improved and inexpensive data for roadway and infrastructure planning. 
            </p>
            <p className="home-text">
                Users can create an account and report issues along their route by opening 
                a "Route Ticket". Whether it be potholes, snow obstructions, poor signage or other concerns,
                Users can report a unique issue by selection "Open a Ticket" and providing details including 
                map position and an optional image.
            </p>
            <p className="home-text">
                If the issue of concern already has an active ticket it will appear on the map. A user can 
                cast a confirmation vote on the ticket to indicate extra urgency to resolve the issue.  Similarily, 
                users can vote on tickets that are resolved to assist with a status and filtering algorithm. 
            </p>
